# Professional README Generator

## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

To help developers create a professional README.md file for their projects, this command-line application dynamically generates a README file based on user input. The application uses the Inquirer package to prompt the user for information about the application repository and then generates a README file with all the necessary information.
